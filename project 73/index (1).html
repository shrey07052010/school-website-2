        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was established in 1978</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">the church was surrounded by trees, which gave it a calming and peaceful sensation, the building was long with a triangular shaped form, with burgundy bricks surroundings and a bit of white in the front entrance and some at the very top and sides with a dark beige roofing to give the church some color, the windows seemed to be a tinted crystal glass that was designed with blues and a beige color. As I made my way into the church their was an entry room where a man and a women and what seemed to be their two children greeted me and handed me a pamphlet that described what was going to take place in that days Sunday school and mass, then I made my way to another pair of doors where I could hear the choir singing, as I opened the doors the inside of the church was a tan wood looking color all around  and had matching tan benches with burgundy red bedding to match the carpet, the thing that stood out most  to me when I walked in was the large cross that was in the very front that shined very bright as if the sun was hitting it to give the whole church light</p>
